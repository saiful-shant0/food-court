            <h3>Kacchi</h3>
            <p>Kacchi Mutton Biryani is a delicious rice dish where tender goat or lamb meat pieces are marinated with
                lots of fried onions, whole spices, fresh herbs and yoghurt. This marinated meat sits on the bottom of
                the pot topped with half-cooked rice which is drizzled with saffron-infused water and more fried onions
                and fresh mint leaves. Sealed and slow-cooked in an oven or on stove-top to a delicious aromatic
                finger-licking biryani that you may serve with some kachumber, salad, and if you are like us, more

            <h3>Chingri curry</h3>
            <p>
                This Chingri Malaikari is a favorite dish in our home and also from the number of hits that recipe gets
                it is clear that it is also a favorite
                among my readers. Now as it happens, in the recent years I got lazy with the dish, and though I made it
                often, I did it with headless shrimp which involved zero cleaning. Until that is, a friend made the
                recipe recently and couldn't get enough of it. She had taken the pains to use prawns with head on and
                reminded me how I had said in my blog post that the "ghilu" adds a fourth dimension to the dish!!!
